# Kernel difference 

There is no `.TF` in the name of the `kernel folder`. Can use the `s9xxx-install.sh` command to write into `EMMC` and use it independently without inserting a `TF card or USB`. The names containing `.TF` only be used in `TF card or USB`, and cannot be written into EMMC using the s9xxx-install.sh command. `TF card or USB` must be used daily.
